AIM:
To implement a triggers using PL|SQL program.
THEROM:
A database triggers is stored in PL|SQL program unit associated with a specific task. No need to all triggers explicit. Triggers are fixed automatically during the occurrence of particular event.
PARTS OF TRIGGERS:
Triggering event Triggering restriction
TRIGGERING EVENT:
It is a statement, that cases a trigger to be fixed.
TIGGERING RESTRUCTION:
A trigger action is the procedure that causes triggering event to be true.

RESULT:
Thus the above procedure for the triggers are successfully and the output is verified
